# A Director Ai For Shooter and Survival Games

## What is a Director Ai?
A Director Ai is a system designed to handle the pacing of a game, orchestrating how the drama unfolds to craft the best experience for the player so that no playthrough is the same as the last. The Director ensures that the player(s) abide to the game rules set by the designers in order to not only create a fair experience but so the Director can enforce peaks and dips of intensity to create a fresh and rewarding experience. 

## How does it work?
The performance of the player(s) is measured by the Director using a stress or intensity metric, which is monitored to determine when a player is having a tough time or when they are finding the game too easy and are in need of a challenge. The Director decides if and when a player should be rewarded with health and ammo drops, or when they should be punished with boss spawns and an increased population of enemies.
